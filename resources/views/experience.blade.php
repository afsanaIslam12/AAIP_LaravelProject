				<h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">My experience in UIU,</h5>
				<p style="text-align: justify-all; margin-top: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;">“It was a completely unknown territory for me when I was admitted to
					BSCSE of UIU in 2003. In fact, I had never operated a computer before. Initially I was a bit excited as well as scared.  Though I had a tough time in the beginning, gradually I became familiar with the logic of computing and programming languages. With the course of time, I had started enjoying different courses. The excellent blend of theories and hands-on labs made this happen. In a word, the CSE department gave me an ideal environment by combining excellent faculty members, study resources and lab facilities to transform myself. Besides curricular works, the CSE department  creates several scopes to enlighten ourselves through participating in programming contests, software festivals, workshops, training programs and internships. These confidence boosting programs helped me a lot to get ready for the IT industry. After graduating in 2007, I joined as a junior Database Engineer to Therap (BD) Ltd, one of the leading multinational IT companies in Bangladesh.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify-all; margin-top: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;">After two and a half years, I came back to UIU to study MCSE.  It’s a toiling task to study while doing a full time job. But the choice, once again, paid me off in a bigger way. I was selected to complete my postgraduate degree in Staffordshire University, UK sponsored by e-LINK project in 2009. When I rejoined Therap (BD) Ltd, a foreign degree in ‘Data Mining’ contributed in numerous ways to strengthen my professional career. As a Senior Database Engineer, I am currently leading a Business Intelligence (BI) project.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify-all; margin-top: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;">It was a tough decision to get enrolled in an unknown subject in a newly started private university. Thanks to Allah that I had made that choice. I believe it is one of the best decisions I have ever made. I also like to thank my parents, UIU management, respected teachers, staff and friends for supporting me in all the ways. Without them, the story could have been different. I hope the department of CSE of UIU will continue its journey for excellence and transforming students to build a better Bangladesh.”

				<h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">I still remember,</h5>
				<p style="text-align: justify-all; margin-top: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;"> the day I first stepped into the UIU campus. I really did not know what kind of career path I would choose. Two weeks into the SPL (Structured Programming Language) course, I discovered something that was driving me, something amazing happened and finally I found myself in a position where I knew what I was going to do. Dr. Hasan Sarwar, Dr. Mohammad Nurul Huda, and Dr. Muhammad Monzurur Rahman some of the faculties I respected most always tried to push me to be my very best and showed what I could really accomplish. It was the small class size and personal interest that the professors take in their students that allows anyone to strive to be what they want to be.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify-all; margin-top: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;">The critical philosophy in UIU’s computer science program that has helped me the most over time was the push to understand the problem rather than to just solve it. Our professors showed us just how important the theories of computer science are in solving problems. These problem-solving skills are something that have changed how I address an issue and something I still use today.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify-all; margin-top: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;">I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree. After graduation, I was offered a lucrative job to be a software engineer at TigerIT Bangladesh Limited, a software and service manufacturer for various government projects. I gladly accepted the offer and have been serving the company since then. I have made a career working in some large-scale government projects (TigerIT) and I am really enjoying my work. Development, thorough testing, and documentation are some of the skills I learned in my undergraduate classes that I have taken to the workplace.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify-all; margin-top: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;">I was also a member of the UIU Computer Club (UIUCCL) for three years where we’ve always practiced team work, dedication and proper time management between academic and extracurricular activities. UIUCCL has remained a big part of my life to this day, and I highly recommend joining the UIUCCL or any campus activities/sports.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify-all; margin-top: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;">Whenever I’ve walked into an interview, I have been proud of my degree from United International University. My Computer Science degree has given me the confidence and motivation to excel at any job I put my mind to. I am pursuing a Master of Computer Science at United International University to help me advance my career even further.</p>
